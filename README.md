## 🧩 Description

This project demonstrates a basic supervised learning model trained on the Iris dataset.  
The app allows users to input flower measurements and see predicted species instantly.

### Model used
- **Decision Tree Classifier** (`sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`)
- Trained on the Iris dataset (`sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`)

### Features:
- Simple UI with Streamlit
- Instant prediction
- Lightweight and reproducible
